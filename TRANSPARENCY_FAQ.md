# About Azure Load Testing Extension for Visual Studio Code

The Azure Load Testing extension for VS Code integrates GitHub Copilot to help developers generate, refine, and scale Locust-based load tests. This extension enables users to quickly create realistic load testing scenarios from existing Postman collections, Insomnia collections, and .http files, iterate locally, and execute high-scale tests in Azure Load Testing.  

With Copilot’s AI-assisted capabilities, users can automate test script generation, customize Locust scripts directly, and generate Azure Load Testing configuration files.  

For more details, visit the [Azure Load Testing documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/load-testing/). The extension is not designed to provide general information on topics outside of Azure Load Testing. 

The primary supported language for the Azure Load Testing extension is English. 

The Azure Load Testing extension works by using a combination of input files (like Postman collections, Insomnia collections, or .http files) with natural language processing and machine learning to understand your question and provide you generated code and guidance. 

## What Happens When I Use Copilot to Generate My Locust Script

The Azure Load Testing extension leverages GitHub Copilot to help users:  
- Generate Locust scripts from API collections with minimal manual effort.  
- Refine and customize Locust scripts through natural language prompts.  
- Generate Azure Load Testing YAML configuration for minimal effort to run a load test in Azure Load Testing.
- Provide guidance for managing secrets in Azure Key Vault with Azure Load Testing. 

The input prompt from the user is pre-processed by the Azure Load Testing extension, combined with contextual information (for example, Azure subscription that is currently selected), and sent to a large language model. User input is in the form of plain language and input files. 

The large language model will take the prompt and provide a response based on the prompt. When the request is to create a new Locust script, a new file with the language language model response is created in the current VS Code workspace. The system is only intended to respond to requests related to load testing.

When you use the @testing chat participant and sign in to your Azure account, the Azure Load Testing extension will be able to gather context from your Azure resources, adhering to the same role-based access controls established in the Azure Portal (enabled by your administrator). 

The Azure Load Testing extension is intended to provide you with the most relevant load Locust test script generation and guidance. However, it may not always provide the answer you are looking for. Users of the Azure Load Testing extension are responsible for reviewing and validating responses generated by the system to ensure they are accurate and appropriate.  

## Improving performance for the Azure Load Testing extension

### Keep your prompts on topic and specific

The Azure Load Testing extension is intended to address queries related to Azure Load Testing exclusively. Therefore, limiting the prompt to Azure questions or tasks can enhance the model's output quality. 

Instead of vague requests like `"Fix my script"`, try:  
✔ `"Modify my Locust script to randomize user credentials from a CSV file"`  
✔ `"Update the Locust script to log response times for each request"`

### Use the Azure Load Testing extension as a tool, not a replacement

While the Azure Load Testing extension can be a powerful tool for interacting with Azure and generating code, it is important to use it as a tool rather than a replacement for human programming. You should always review and test the code generated by the extension to ensure that it meets your requirements and is free of errors or security concerns.

### Use secure coding and code review practices

While the Azure Load Testing extension can generate syntactically correct code, it may not always be secure. You should always follow best practices for secure coding, such as avoiding hard-coded passwords or SQL injection vulnerabilities, as well as following code review best practices, to address the Azure Load Testing extension’s limitations. 

## Provide feedback

If you encounter any issues or limitations with the Azure Load Testing extension, we recommend that you provide feedback by creating an issue in the https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-azure-load-testing/issues repository. This can help the developers to improve the tool and address any concerns or limitations.

## Stay up to date

The Azure Load Testing extension is a new technology and is likely to evolve over time. You should stay up to date with any updates or changes to the tool, as well as any new security risks or best practices that may emerge. Automated extension updates are enabled by default in Visual Studio Code. If you have automatic updates enabled, Copilot Chat will automatically update to the latest version when you open Visual Studio Code. For more information on automatic updates in Visual Studio code, see the Visual Studio Code documentation. 

## Limitations of the Azure Load Testing extension

Depending on factors such as your access to Azure resources and input data, you may experience different levels of performance when using the Azure Load Testing extension. The following information is designed to help you understand system limitations and key concepts about performance as they apply to the Azure Load Testing extension. 

### Limited scope

For interacting with Azure Load Testing resources, you can only read information or perform tasks like deploying new resources if you have the access required to do so in the Azure Portal. In addition, there is information available in the Azure Portal that may not be available via the Azure Load Testing extension. 

For code generation, GitHub Copilot has been trained on a large body of code but still has a limited scope and may not be able to handle more complex code structures or obscure programming languages. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. 

### Potential biases

Copilot's training data is drawn from existing code repositories, which may contain biases and errors that can be perpetuated by the tool. Additionally, the Azure Load Testing extension may be biased towards certain programming languages, coding styles, or API patterns which can lead to suboptimal or incomplete code suggestions. 

### Security risks

The Azure Load Testing extension can generate code based on the context of the question and any code that is included as context, which can potentially expose sensitive information or vulnerabilities if not used carefully. You should be careful when using the Azure Load Testing extension to generate code for security-sensitive applications and always review and test the generated code thoroughly. 

### Inaccurate code

One of the limitations of the Azure Load Testing extension is that it may generate code snippets or CLI commands that appear to be valid but may not actually be semantically or syntactically correct or may not accurately reflect the intent of the developer. To mitigate the risk of inaccuracies, you should carefully review and test the generated code and CLI commands, particularly when dealing with critical or sensitive applications. You should also ensure that the generated code adheres to best practices and design patterns and fits within the overall architecture and style of the codebase. 

### Inaccurate responses to non-coding topics

The Azure Load Testing extension is not designed to answer non-load testing questions, and therefore its responses may not always be accurate or helpful in these contexts. If a user asks the Azure Load Testing extension a non-load testing question, it may generate an answer that is irrelevant or nonsensical, or it may simply indicate that it is unable to provide a useful response.
